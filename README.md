# MCs_110-116
This contains data on Members of Congress (MCs) from the 110th to 116th Congress 

MC characteristics are collected using Carnes' (2016) Congressional Leadership and Social Class Dataset (https://people.duke.edu/~nwc8/class.html), Daily Kos Comprehensive Congressional Guides for the 113th-116th Congresses, MC websites, news sites and the Congressional Biographical Directory. I first matched characteristics from Carnes (2016) and DailyKos data to the MCs in my dataset. For MCs not included in these datasets, I coded characteristics by hand, using MC websites, campaign websites, congressional caucuses, and news sites.
